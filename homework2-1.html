        <h1>Bulk Up Workout and Diet</h1>
        <p>Effective bulking requires proper exercise and diet. Bulking is not only about building muscle, but also about managing body fat while increasing muscle mass. The key here is balancing exercise and diet. Exercise stimulates the muscles, while the diet provides the necessary nutrients to create an optimal growth environment. Consistency and a systematic plan are essential. This page will cover the workout and diet for bulking in detail.</p>

        <h2>Workout</h2>
        <p>Bulking workouts require high-intensity exercises, primarily including weight training and compound exercises. Gradually increasing the weight to provide continuous stimulation to the muscles is important. Compound exercises like squats, bench presses, and deadlifts develop multiple muscle groups at once, promoting more calorie consumption and muscle growth. Additionally, adequate rest after exercise is crucial for muscle recovery. By adjusting sets and repetitions according to your workout routine, you can maximize muscle growth and development.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Squat</strong>: A representative exercise for strengthening the lower body and core.</li>
            <li><strong>Bench Press</strong>: Develops upper body muscles, especially the chest and shoulders.</li>
            <li><strong>Deadlift</strong>: A key compound exercise for developing full-body muscle strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Pull-up</strong>: Strengthens the back and arm muscles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>A bulking diet is based on a high-calorie, high-protein diet to provide the energy and nutrients necessary for muscle growth. After workouts, it is important to properly combine protein and carbohydrates for quick recovery. Protein is an essential nutrient for muscle recovery and growth, and you should aim to consume about 1.6–2.2g of protein per kg of body weight. Carbohydrates supply energy during exercise, and fats play a crucial role in balancing hormones. Additionally, excessive calorie intake can lead to increased body fat, so it is important to maintain a balanced diet focusing on healthy foods.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protein</strong>: An essential nutrient for muscle growth, requiring 1.6–2.2g/kg of protein intake per day.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong>: Play a critical role in recovery and energy supply post-workout.</li>
            <li><strong>Fats</strong>: Healthy fats support hormone balance and cell health.</li>
        </ul>
