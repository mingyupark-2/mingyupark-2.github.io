<h1>My First Heading-박민규</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.-PMG</p>

Hello everyone, thank you very much for reading my travel posts. I'm going to tell you about the things I saw when I went on a 2-day trip to England and 2-day trip to France when I was in high school. On day 1, I arrived in England and went to Harry Potter studio, which I was looking forward to from the moment I walked in the door, of course, because I love the Harry Potter movies. There were a lot of things to see, but one of the most impressive things I saw was a scaled-down model of Harry Potter studio on a big board. On day 2, I went to Tower Bridge, Greenwich Observatory, and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Tower Bridge is something I've seen a lot in movies, but it was so big and grand in person, and at the Greenwich Observatory, they have the Prime Meridian, so I was excited to see it and realize that I'm halfway around the world. At the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, it was brand new at the time, and it was huge, and I went in the players' locker room, and I saw Son Heung-min's jersey hanging there, and I was in awe. The next day, I took the train from England to France, and we came out at night, and it was lit up, and I saw the Eiffel Tower, and it was unreal from a distance, but up close, it was so tall and big. Then we went to the Arc de Triomphe and went up to the observation deck and saw Paris at night and it was beautiful. Finally, on the fourth day, we went to the Louvre and saw the sunflower painting, the Mona Lisa painting, and the Mona Lisa was heavily guarded and you could only see it from 5-10 meters away. Our last stop was Mont Saint-Michel, which is the real-life location of the Disney cartoon. We saw Mont Saint-Michel at night, and the lights from inside Mont Saint-Michel combined with the stars in the sky gave it a colorful look that I could only admire. Mont Saint-Michel was the most impressive and colorful part of the trip for me. If you ever get the chance to go there, I highly recommend London, England and Paris, France because there are so many great places to eat. Thank you for reading this long post. Have a great day~!
